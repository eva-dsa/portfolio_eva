				Thesis: virtual reality, a real opportunity for in-company training?
			</h1>
				<h2>
					Summary of my master degree thesis
				</h2>
					<p>
						In an ever-changing context it is particularly important for companies to be able to demonstrate adaptability. Optimising and developing the skills of its employees is a fundamental element enabling the company to adapt to changes that occur in its environment. In-company training therefore appears to be an important element for the company's adaptability. There is a range of training tools that are more or less effective. Virtual reality is now part of this panel that is offered to companies. It even appears to be a trendy tool, even if it is still relatively little used. <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The aim of this essay is to study whether or not virtual reality represents a real opportunity for in-company training. To answer this question, research, analysis and cross-referencing of data from two studies on the impact of virtual reality on the development and retention of different types of skills (technical and soft skills), as well as interviews with professionals involved in the development of virtual reality as an in-company training tool have been carried out. Finally, to complete the analysis and in order to better understand this technology and its potential, I chose to experience virtual reality several times.<br>  
					</p>
					<p>
						All this led to the fact that virtual reality is indeed a tool that represents an opportunity for in-company training. In fact, this technology has many advantages in terms of training: as an exceptionally immersive and interactive technology, it really makes learning easier for the learner, it gives great freedom to model environments, allows for large-scale training and for monitoring employee performance. It also proves to be an economically favourable tool when the scale of delivery is sufficient. <br>  
					</p>
					<p>
						However, it is important not to lose sight of the current limitations of this tool in order to optimise its use and avoid the risks it carries as much as possible. It does not yet seem relevant in all contexts and for all skills. Virtual reality, in the current state of technology, is more relevant in the development of technical skills (industrial sector in particular) and for certain soft skills for which the environment has a strong impact. <br>
