		<h2>
			Definition
		</h2>
		<p>
			Web scraping with Python is the use of an <b>algorithm</b> written with Python <b>to extract and process
				large amounts
				of data from the web</b>.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The project
		</h2>
		<p>
			I wrote a web scraping code in Python to obtain an <b>automatically generated excel with KPI wanted about
				world countries from <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/" class="link"><i>the World Factbook</i></a></b>.
			As you can see in the figure below, the output is an excel sheet with all
			the KPI selected by the user <i>(in blue)</i> about each country in the world <i>(in yellow)</i>. In this
			form the data
			<i>(in green)</i> can be easily exploited by people.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Why this project?
		</h2>
		<p>
			I thought about this project when I was doing an <b>internship as a strategic analyst</b> in a company. I
			observed
			that some people needed to create and update data relating to a number of countries in order to enable the
			relevant people to make strategic decisions, particularly in terms of international development.
		</p>
		<p>
			The process <b>was time consuming and very repetitive</b>. For each country people had to find, copy and
			past all information
			needed in an excel document. It was not efficient to waste time on such repetitive processes for employees
			who could be working on tasks that require their special skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			This finding led me to <b>want to learn how to automate such tasks</b>.
